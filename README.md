                                                  Microservices Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a microservices-based architecture using modern cloud-native technologies.
It is structured into several key components, with a focus on building scalable, maintainable services using Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.

            Key Technologies:

Microservices Architecture: Each service is developed independently, with clear separation of concerns.

Docker & Kubernetes: Services are containerized using Docker and deployed using Kubernetes for scalability and fault tolerance.

SQL Server: Persistent data storage with SQL Server, deployed in Kubernetes using Persistent Volume Claims.

RabbitMQ: Implements asynchronous messaging between services to decouple them and improve performance.

gRPC: Enables efficient communication between services with Protocol Buffers for serializing structured data.

API Gateway: Centralized entry point for handling external requests and routing them to appropriate services.

  
            Features:

Platform Service - The core service, handles business logic and communicates with other services using HTTP and gRPC.

Command Service - Manages and processes commands from the Platform Service, connected via HTTP and gRPC clients.

Database Integration - Uses SQL Server for data persistence, fully integrated with Kubernetes.

Asynchronous Messaging - RabbitMQ is used for event-driven communication between services, allowing for loose coupling.

gRPC Communication - Services leverage gRPC for faster communication and data serialization.

Containerization and Orchestration - Services are fully containerized using Docker and orchestrated in a Kubernetes environment.

Scalability - The system is designed to scale easily by adding more instances of services in Kubernetes.
